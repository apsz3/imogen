@param myvar -- supply it with CLI.

Side Effects:
* loop var
* random and file/io:

Expressions that get re-executed in their lifetime need to have their value assigned to a
temporary value in their scope and all references IN that scope use it.
When it goes out of scope, reset it to the generating expression, so that we can
re-gen things.


x Add random

Add tags and attachable metadata to objects

Render objects to a JSON manifest with metadata and paths to the objects

`script` tag that indicates the file should not run but can be called.
    We need this to signal deferred execution but not ignored execution like `local`

# Thoughts on user interactivity:

Introduce different annotations for parameters.
Tweak = it goes into the UI. For example, if we have a fractional offset of where we place something, you want to make that tweakable. Same for colors.
export text = "Default text"
Type check on the default, tells you what to have in the GUI, e.g. text input, slider, knob, bool, etc.
knob / switch etc compile to the gui you get.
switch is bool knob is range, textinput , etc.
Export = modifiable in gui
Extern = inputted with CLI... can also be modified in gui?
Maybe just extend for extension
ext text = "yeet"
ext size = (512, 512)

Godot's editor paradigm can probably be leveraged here
